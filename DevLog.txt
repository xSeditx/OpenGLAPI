Created a Window class and populated it using Callback functions with various data such as keyboard input, mouse buttons, error handlers and
things of that nature. The Global Active Window is stored in GLFWWindow *SCREEN variable which is contained in a global state and points to the 
Current target of the API functions. A window is contructed with the Window Constructor Window(x,y, width, height, "Title") at which point 
the constructor creates the window and then assigns the newly constructed object to SCREEN so that it becomes the target of all the 
Window API seen here.

       Current Data Handled and Functions created these are contained under Private in the Window class and used to 
	   populate the class with useful data about the current state of the window.

Something is wrong with the Mouse.SHOW command and I have to click both buttons to trigger the RIGHT button to show true.
